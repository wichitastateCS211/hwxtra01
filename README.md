# Bubble, Bubble, Toil and Bubble Sort an Array of Strings
Write a C++ program which will prompt the user to enter some words, and then sort the words in alphabetical order and display them.

## Requirements
- Read in words until an empty string is received (user just hits enter).
  - You may assume that the words will not contain whitespace.
- Sort the words using the bubble sort algorithm.
  - Sorting must be in true alphabetical order, meaning that the upper case and lower case versions of a letter must be treated as equal.
- Print the alphabetized list of words to tthe screen, witth one word per line.

## Sample Run
```
Enter a word: dog
Enter a word: Dogs
Enter a word: beaver
Enter a word: Cat
Enter a word: Mouse
Enter a word: rabbit
Enter a word: 

Your sorted list:
beaver
Cat
dog
Dogs
Mouse
rabbit
```

## Hints
- Recall that by default strings are sorted in lexicographical order.
- Reall further lexicographical is identical to alphabetical if both words are completely upper case or lower case.

## Reminders
- Name your file *wsuid*\_hwxtra01.cpp
- You are required to place a comment block at the top of the file. Refer to the Coding Guidelines
handout.
